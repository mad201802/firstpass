#FirstPass
The best Password Manager in the World!

FirstPass is designed to allow users to store their passwords securely and easily. Among other things, we offer a password generator that automatically generates secure passwords. This is seamlessly integrated into the manager and can be configured as desired. But not only username and password can be stored: It is also possible to save a URL to the website to access it more easily. It is also possible to leave a note, which is of course also encrypted. The security of the data has the highest priority for us!
